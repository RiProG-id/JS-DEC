# VmodsDec.sh
`VmodsDec.sh` is a JavaScript deobfuscator script specifically tailored for Vmods. It utilizes the `js-deobfuscator` tool in combination with `prettier` to transform obfuscated JavaScript code into a more readable format.

## Prerequisites

The following tools are required to run `VmodsDec.sh`:

- **git**: Required to clone the necessary repository.
- **Node.js**: Required to run the deobfuscation tool.

If these tools are not already installed, you can set up the environment by running the script with the `--setup` flag.

## Installation

Run the following command to set up your environment:

```sh
bash VmodsDec.sh --setup
```

This command will:

- Update and upgrade your system's package list.
- Install `git` and `Node.js`.

## Usage

`VmodsDec.sh` can be used for both single-file input and directory input, processing `.js` files for deobfuscation.

### Running the Script

To execute the script:

```sh
bash /VmodsDec.sh
```

You will be prompted to enter a file or directory location:

- For a **single JavaScript file**, enter the full file path.
- For **multiple files in a directory**, enter the directory path containing the `.js` files.
