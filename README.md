# JS-DEC
This script deobfuscates JavaScript code and formats it for better readability. It also uses a dictionary to replace obfuscated identifiers with meaningful names, improving code comprehension.

## Prerequisites

The following tools are required to run `JSDEC.sh`:

- **git**: Required to clone the necessary repository.
- **Node.js**: Required to run the deobfuscation tool.
- **pv**: Required for controlling the speed of output when processing files.
- **js-deobfuscator**: The tool used for deobfuscating JavaScript files.

If these tools are not already installed, you can set up the environment by running the script with the `--setup` flag.

## Installation

Run the following command to set up your environment:

```sh
bash JSDec.sh --setup
```

This command will:

Update and upgrade your system's package list.

Install git, Node.js, and pv.

Set up the JavaScript deobfuscation environment by cloning the necessary repository.

## Usage

After the installation is complete, run the script to start deobfuscating JavaScript files. You will be given two options:

```sh
bash JSDec.sh --setup
```

- For a **single JavaScript file**, enter the full file path.
- For **multiple files in a directory**, enter the directory path containing the `.js` files.

Examples:
- For a single file: `/home/user/scripts/example.js`
- For a directory: `/home/user/scripts`

Follow the next instructions provided by the script to complete the deobfuscation process.
